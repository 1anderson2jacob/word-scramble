        <p>Jake grew up on legos, little did he know they wouldn't just be the building blocks of the castle he was
          making but also the building blocks for problem solving skills and lego piece bartering skills. Will graduate
          Code Fellows in February of 2019 with a degree in software design. If there's one thing that puts the motion
          in
          this man's ocean commotion it's playing card games with friends.

        <img src="../img/Becca_Lee_About.jpg" alt="Becca Lee" title="Becca Lee" />
        <p>Becca is a voracious learner who loves to translate her knowledge and intuition into thoughtful,
          user-focused
          strategies. She's currently learning about JavaScript at Code Fellows and is excited to apply her learning
          and
          creativity to user-centric apps (and yes, as a stereotypical Virgo she is absolutely keeping a list of app
          ideas she's excited to build someday). Before learning to code, Becca worked as a tech marketer at
          Formidable.
          She loves the ocean, particularly the deep sea, because tbh, deep sea creatures are EXTREMELY cool.

          To all future 201 students who are seeing this as an example of what a really great project looks like: stick
          to it, study hard and stay in school! You'll make it! By now hopefully I'm working at some legit tech company
          building powerful tools that help tons of people!
          I enjoy walks on the beach and popping the bulbs on the ends of those long kelp things.
