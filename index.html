      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Ocean Commotion, a word scramble game with an oceanic theme!</p>
      <p>When you hit start on the game page, the timer will begin counting down from 2 minutes and a scrambled word will be displayed. Every time you unscramble and guess a word correctly, 15 seconds will be added to the timer, up to a maximum of 5 minutes of gameplay. Within that time, solve as many words as you can to maximize your score! No time will be deducted for an incorrect word, but you will get a 15 second penalty if you use the skip button to move on to a new word without guessing.</p>

      <h2>Tips for Gameplay</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You can either click the submit button or click enter on the keyboard to submit your guess.</li>
        <li>Your score will be calculated by the number of letters in each word you guess correctly, so the more words
          you answer, the higher your score!</li>
        <li>If you're really stuck, the skip button can be your friend. You'll lose 15 seconds of game time, but that
          may be a better choice than staying stuck on the word for a longer time.</li>
        <li>Remember, this is a THEMED puzzle, so if you guess a real word but it's not Ocean-related, you won't get
          points. But don't worry- we'll let you know if that happens.</li>
